## Flutter Community
**A central place for all community made Flutter packages.**

The Flutter Community is a GitHub organisation used to manage community made Flutter packages.

Our goal is to ensure packages made by the Flutter community are kept alive and maintained in one place.

### Medium Articles
To go along with the packages we have start a Medium publication again as a central location for community content to be published. Especially if it relates to the packages here.

### Package Owners
This is only a branding change. The idea is to promote the integrity of packages. Not all packaged will be accepted.

If you would like to see your package in the organisation please contact us in the Study Group, alternatively you can get in contact though the Google Group https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flutter-community or email the group flutter-community@googlegroups.com.
